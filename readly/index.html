        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Context</h1>
          <p>As technology develops, nothing remains untouched and paper is no exception. As great as it is, there seems to be a lot of room for the medium to grow in order to read digitally. Thus, we decided to frame our project as a reading app with features which physical books cannot bring.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Our Research</h1>
          <p>We began our project by researching factors that may frustrate a reader from reading more. A few insights stood out for us.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="process-subtitle">Unable to control themselves</li>
              <li>Readers talk about reading books or purchasing books all the time, but they never really get on the habit of reading those books. </li>
            <li class="process-subtitle">Unable to find the next book they want to read </li>
              <li>Readers don’t know how to find books they are interested in. Manually searching for books is a tiring process. Cause they are also not sure whether the tiring process will take them to the book that they want to read.</li>
            <li class="process-subtitle">Inexperienced readers are more likely to give up</li>
            <li>Readers who lack self-control are more likely to hold true for beginning readers who want to get on the habit of reading. Since they usually start reading due to a short-term motivation, it is very easy for them to let time slide and eventually give up quickly. </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="process-subtitle">With these insights, we framed our questions to ask:</p>
          <p class="position-title">How might we help beginning readers maintain a reading habit?</p>

          <figure class="process-img-item">
            <img src="../img/readly/persona.jpg" alt="Designing Readly for our persona">
            <figcaption>Designing Readly for our persona</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Challenge</h1>
          <p>Based on the insight, I quickly made the user journey and a persona to conceptualize what the potential touchpoints may be. However, by analyzing the user-flow, I realized that there were ample opportunities in order to enhance the reading experience. However, we still cannot come up with the appropriate solution to address the problem we proposed, which is to maintain the reading habit. I suggested to conduct a user-testing of wireframes among our target audience in the hope of receiving new insights. As the facilitator for user-testing, I set up the testing section and prepared an exit questionnaire for users to fill out.</p>
          <figure class="process-img-item">
            <img src="../img/readly/wireframe.jpg" alt="Initial wireframes for Readly - Setting up recommendation">
            <figcaption>Initial wireframes for Readly - Setting up recommendation</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>As a result, I was able to interact with the users and gain fresh ideas based on the interview we did during user-testing. We realized that our initial design relates heavily to the display of books and reading experience instead of a tangible way to encourage people to continue reading, e.g. setting a goal. Based on that, I was able to consolidate the project goals and move forward with high-fidelity mock-ups. Also, considering persona, Sheryl desires to interact with like-mineded people. I came up with a feature called book challenge to create a sense of community for readers to read more in the supportive environment.</p>
          <figure class="process-img-item">
            <img src="../img/readly/project-goals.jpg" alt="Project goals for Readly">
            <figcaption>Project goals for Readly</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

      <div class="process-content-column">
        <div class="process-content-column-divide">
          <h1 class="process-title">Proposal</h1>
          <p>Since all these four features are building towards one goal, maintaining a reading habit. We proposed a reading that will encompass the four features which help inexperienced readers to maintain a long-term reading habit and to gain more knowledge. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-content-column-divide">
          <figure class="process-img-item">
            <img src="../img/readly/entry.jpg" alt="Entry to Readly">
            <figcaption>Entry to Readly</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Prototype</h1>
          <p>I prototyped most of the final mock-ups with Sketch, a tool that works well for creating the task flow. I was in charge of the most look and design of the app. Combining athletics and functionality, I proposed to use light blue, which is emotionally soothing for users while reading, and card-based interface, which is convenient for the users digest optimal amount of information at a time, such as short reviews for a book that your friend has read.  </p>
        </div>

          <h1 class="process-title">Features</h1>
          <p>I prototyped most of the final mock-ups with Sketch, a tool that works well for creating the task flow. I was in charge of the most look and design of the app. Combining athletics and functionality, I proposed to use light blue, which is emotionally soothing for users while reading, and card-based interface, which is convenient for the users digest optimal amount of information at a time, such as short reviews for a book that your friend has read. </p>

          <p>I designed the onboarding experience with natural languages to allow user personalize their interests. Copywriting such as what kind of reader are you are more user-friendly, thus humanizing digital experience and providing them the information they need in a way that feels genuine.</p>
          <figure class="process-img-item">
            <img src="../img/readly/feature1.jpg" alt="Feature 1 - Recommending books">
            <figcaption>Feature 1 - Recommending books</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The second feature is the reaches the main goal of our app by allowing users to customize their own goal. By setting goals for yourself you give yourself a long-term vision. It helps the user to organize her time so that she can reach the reading goal.</p>
          <figure class="process-img-item">
            <img src="../img/readly/feature2.jpg" alt="Feature 2 - Setting reading goal">
            <figcaption>Feature 2 - Setting reading goal</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Book challenge is a way to gather people with the similar reading goal and to complete the booklist within certain time period. Based on our research, a reading list will help readers stay organized. I intended to show reading journey of one reader in an inspiring way, thus other challengers can line up to make that transformation go further.
           </p>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Although the user journey helps us to explore what the users think and do. I  think there’s still a discrepancy between user testing and user analysis. User-testing is essential to make the project more human-oriented. Thus I have learnt that the combination of user mapping and user testing can be an effective way to stimulate the use scenarios which help me to further improve the user experience. </p>
          <p>Moreover, the iterative design process allows me to become a better copywriter as each word of choice can imply different user experience. I have learnt to use professional terminology for the client to understand the scope of the design, and to use natural language for users to come onboard during the friendly reading experience.</p>
