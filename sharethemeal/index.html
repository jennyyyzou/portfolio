          <h1 class="process-title">Context</h1>
          <p><a href="https://sharethemeal.org/en/values.html" class="in-text-link">ShareTheMeal</a>, created by United Nations, is a mobile app that allows users to make micro-donations towards solving world hunger. We decided to frame our project as a way to improve donating experience for donors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Our Research</h1>
          <p>We began our project by doing individual research. After browsing through the website and user research, I realized that what company aims is quite differently from what user feels.  </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="process-subtitle">Transparency</li>
              <li>As one of the core value of ShareTheMeal, is not fully implemented as the company intends to show “progress and where meals are distributed”. </li>
            <li class="process-subtitle">Community-building</li>
              <li>ShareTheMeal includes a social aspect contributing to community building, which intends to promote motivation among team members to fight world hunger together. </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="process-subtitle">Insights</p>
          <p> Donors are unsure where their generosity have went, and how much they have donated. It’s also very inconvenient for donors to make use of the team feature as there are no other values than donating under a team name.</p>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Challenge</h1>
          <p>The conflict between the two stakeholders pique our interests, hence we decided to ideate features to solve the problem. My role in this process still involves a large amount of researching, as I intend to analyze what precedents have incorporated and explored more apps with similar functions. Whereas, I stumbled at this step as I did not know how to combine what I found relates to the problem. </p>
          <p>Initially, I thought of a feature making a connection with the beneficiary to indicate the whereabouts of the donation. Yet, we did not realize the secure nature of ShareTheMeal in our initial research. We then continued to iterate and search for more inspiration. This process was very lengthy, but I discovered the similarity between donation app and sports app. They can both make people feel rewarding about their actions.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I was inspired from <a href="https://www.strava.com/" class="in-text-link">Strava</a> and came up with an impact tracker for individual and team to improve the donating experience. Considering the target audience, I think we can satisfy persona's goal by allowing people to view each other's impact tracker.  Hence, impact tracker can bridge the misunderstandings by allowing donors to track their previous donation history as well as to keep informed of the positive impact made by the teammates. This can lead to a more efficient donating experience and consolidation of our proposal.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">Proposal</h1>
          <p>We proposed an impact tracker feature to enable users to track their own contribution for individual and community donations, allowing them to have a rewarding experience. Additionally, users can track and inspire from contribution of other community members, motivating each other with collective impact on the same cause. This not only allows users to feel proud of their generosity, but engages with community members who share the same value to make the collective impact further. </p>

        <div class="process-content">
          <h1 class="process-title">My Role</h1>
          <p>I helped with UX/UI design of our interface as well as the copywriter in the project. For initial ideation, I drew multiple sketches and wireframes to vision what the app looks like with the main features. </p>

          <div class="process-content-column-divide">
            <h1 class="process-title">Interface</h1>
            <p>I helped with interface design of our interface. In order to conform out what ShareTheMeal original style, I made use of the card-based interface, and actively used the colour palette yellow and blue to emphasize our feature. Impact Tracker is positioned in the profile. Upon tapping, the card will lead to the page for Impact Tracker. </p>

          <p>Under the overview tab, the user is able to view his weekly donation and his overall impact globally in a visual way. Thus the user can feel safe by viewing his past donations and feel proud of what his donation has impacted. </p>

        <div class="process-content">
          <p>To have a sense of social aspect, I designed the community tab allowing the user to view his contribution within a team. Instead of showing the results in a form of the leaderboard, I want to encourage the user by emphasizing how much he has donated only.  Moreover, under the activity feed, our persona is able to communicate with other teammates. Also, showing the journey of one impact client in an inspiring way can drive more people to make that transformation go further.</p>

          <h1 class="process-title">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Impact Tracker was successful as our extensive research supported our argument and solution. The feature is very subtle but incorporates well into the original interface and is crucial to enhance the donating experience. Thus I gained a great appreciation for research that helps me to identify the design problem and crystalize the solution to solve the problem. </p>
          <p>Furthermore, this project was an introduction project for me to user experience. It provided a great opportunity to learn about the connections between the existing company and consistent design, and the significance of empathizing and designing for people. I have learnt that the design of the interface should be intentional instead of beautiful. The underlying thought process can play an important part to determine each meaningful detail on the interface. Moving forward, I will practise more on the prototyping skills to present a refined interface, so that an iterative user testing can be facilitated for more feedback from users.</p>
